    "text": "💻 Data Manipulation and visualisation in R (2025 – present)\n\n\n\nThis course is designed for students interested in learning how to effectively manipulate and visualise data using R programming language.\nWe introduce advanced methods of data manipulation and visualisation in R, especially using libraries from the tidyverse collection (tidyr, dplyr, tibble, purrr, stringr, ggplot2, readr). The goal of the course is to teach students routine data manipulation, enabling them to import, edit, filter, and attach new information from external data sources. This includes creating new variables (e.g., based on calculations), grouping samples by specific characteristics or information, and calculating other parameters for these groups.\nStudents will also learn basic and advanced methods of data visualisation using ggplot2 and create basic maps in R.\nThe goal of the course is also to adopt the open data science approach, where students will learn how to prepare a script that can be published on the GitHub platform at the end.\nStudy materials for this course are available on this website: https://botzooldataanalysis.github.io/DataManipulationVisualisation/data_manipulation_visualisation.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🌱 Field course of geobotany (2024 – present)\n\n\n\nThe Field course of geobotany is an intensive, five-day course held at the field station outside Brno. The main aim is the introduction of basic skills and field methods used in vegetation ecology (recording phytosociological relevés, measuring and estimation of basic stand parameters, soil sampling and chemical analysis, microclimatic measurements, manipulative experiment, vegetation mapping).\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about the course, see: https://is.muni.cz/course/sci/jaro2026/BI6661?lang=en\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📈 Data analysis in community ecology (2023–2024)\n\n\n\nThe course introduces methods of statistical analysis of data on species composition of plant or animal communities, irrespective of their taxonomic delimitation. The principal course topics include advanced data manipulation techniques, analyses of diversity, ordination methods, and numerical classification. At the end of this course, students should be able to apply the methods discussed in the R environment.\nFor more information about the course, see: https://is.muni.cz/course/sci/podzim2025/BI7542?lang=en\nTogether with Kryštof Chytrý, we prepared a cookbook for the basics of the use of unconstrained and constrained ordinations (in Czech): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M2dbkbGgy2kv5Ch43CHIBJdBTIsJSdR-kZVt4wlsiDI/edit?usp=sharing\nMore study materials are going to be added to this website: https://botzooldataanalysis.github.io/CommunityEcology/community_ecology.html"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The comprehensive analysis of all available non-forest vegetation-plot time series data from the Czech Republic revealed considerable temporal changes in habitat quality. Species richness increased over time in most habitat types, however, there were significant shifts in taxonomic and functional community composition, indicating a decline in habitat quality. Habitat specialists and threatened species became less represented in plant communities. Woody species, tall herbaceous plants, grasses, and strong competitors, as well as nutrient-demanding species and species successful in the colonisation of new habitats, increased in all non-forest habitats. At the same time, light-demanding species declined, suggesting an effect of eutrophication and natural succession following the abandonment of traditional management practices. We did not identify any significant trend in the representation of neophytes. There were considerable differences in temporal trends between individual habitat types, suggesting varying importance of multiple threatening factors. In wetlands, springs, and mires, moisture-demanding species decreased, probably due to drainage, river regulations, and increasing drought resulting from climate change. Dry grasslands, ruderal, weed, along with sand and shallow-soil vegetation became more mesic, and successional processes were most pronounced in these communities, suggesting a stronger effect of abandonment of traditional management and eutrophication. In alpine and subalpine vegetation, meadows and mesic pastures, Nardus grasslands and heathlands, insect-pollinated species declined, and the proportion of grasses increased.\nKlinkovská, K., Sperandii M.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The main types of sand grasslands in the Vienna Basin have persisted over recent decades and have not been replaced by other vegetation types. However, there have been significant changes in the species composition of sand vegetation. Among the most decreasing species were several sand and dry grassland specialists, e.g., Cynodon dactylon, Jasione montana, Pimpinella saxifraga, Seseli annuum, and Thymus serpyllum. In contrast, neophytes, e.g., Erigeron annuus, and graminoids, e.g., Agrostis vinealis, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Calamagrostis epigejos, Carex liparocarpos, and Poa pratensis agg., were among the species that increased most. The overall species richness increased over time, yet the proportion of sand and dry grassland specialists declined in the whole dataset. The decline in sand specialists was most pronounced in the pioneer sand vegetation. There were no significant changes in the proportion of ruderal and threatened species. The proportion of alien species per plot was very low and remained unchanged over time. However, the summed frequency of alien species increased from 91 occurrences in the old plot observations to 147 in the new plot observations, and the frequency of some alien species increased between the first survey and the resurvey. There were also some neophyte species that occurred only in the new plot observations, e.g. Asclepias syriaca. Ellenberg-type indicator values for moisture and nutrients increased significantly, while indicator values for grazing pressure decreased. In pioneer sand vegetation, indicator values for temperature decreased significantly. In acidophilous and ruderalised sand grasslands, there was a marginally significant increase in indicator values for moisture, nutrients and disturbance severity, while indicator values for grazing pressure decreased significantly. There were no significant changes in indicator values in basiphilous sand grasslands except for a marginally significant increase in indicator values for soil disturbance.\nFriesová, K., Axmanová, I., Borovyk, D., Ćuk, M., Kopčan, B., Valachovič, M., Clark, A.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this methodological study, we assessed the accuracy of two-visit resurveys of plots by comparing their results with long-term trends in species richness and community turnover. We compiled a dataset of real-world permanent-plot time series that were sampled multiple times, often annually. Then, we extracted pairs of surveys from the individual time series and compared models based on these with models based on the full time series using Bayesian multilevel regressions. We found that two-visit resurveys accurately predicted long-term trends in community turnover. However, in the case of species richness, these resurveys converged with the predicted long-term trends in only half of the cases. The two-visit resurveys remain a vital tool for understanding changes in plant diversity, however, they should be used cautiously, with a focus on species composition rather than species richness.\nChytrý, K., Clark, A.

    "text": "Acidophilous dry grasslands in southwestern Moravia have been relatively stable over the past 30 years. However, a slow decline in habitat quality has been observed. The total species richness, the number of threatened species and the number of dry grassland specialists significantly decreased over the past 30 years. Dry grassland specialists, e.g., Asperula cynanchica, Campanula moravica, Carlina acaulis, Euphrasia stricta, Pulsatilla grandis and Pilosella echioides were among the species showing the strongest decline. Among the most increasing species were annual species, e.g., Bromus hordeaceus, Petrorhagia prolifera, Trifolium arvense, and Veronica dillenii, juvenile woody plants, e.g., Prunus sp., Quercus petraea, and Rosa sp. Overall, there was a significant increase in annual and woody species. The increase in alien species was mainly driven by an increase in archaeophytes, while neophytes remained rare in both time periods. The tall competitive grass Arrhenatherum elatius, considered an archaeophyte in the study area, appeared among the most increasing species. The decline in species richness was significantly associated with the increase in Arrhenatherum cover. The only change in ecological indicator values was an increase in indicator values for nutrients. These trends signalling a decline in habitat quality were less pronounced in protected areas than outside of them.\nHarásek, M., Klinkovská, K. & Chytrý, M. (2023).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Basiphilous semi-dry grasslands in the Central Moravian Carpathians experienced significant changes in species composition over the past four decades. Species richness, the proportion of threatened species and dry grassland specialists, typically xerophilous and light-demanding species decreased. Asperula cynanchica, Bupleurum falcatum, Campanula moravica, C. sibirica, Linum catharticum, and Pulsatilla grandis belonged to the most declining species. On the other hand, competitively stronger species with higher moisture and nutrient requirements increased together with juvenile woody species, e.g. Cornus sanguinea, Crataegus sp., Prunus sp., and Rosa sp. Among the most increasing species were also forest herbs, e.g., Brachypodium sylvaticum, Clinopodium vulgare, and Viola riviniana, and species with a ruderal tendency, e.g., Agrimonia eupatoria, Cirsium arvense, and Geum urbanum. Most plots belonged to the same vegetation type in both time periods, however, some dry grasslands evolved towards more mesophilous communities. Narrow-leaved dry grasslands (Festucion valesiacae) became broad-leaved semi-dry grasslands (Cirsio- Brachypodion pinnati) and broad-leaved dry grasslands (Cirsio-Brachypodion pinnati and Bromion erecti) became mesic grasslands (Arrhenatherion elatioris). Indicator values for light, temperature and disturbance frequency decreased significantly, while indicator values for moisture and nutrients increased. Outside protected areas, the decline of dry grassland specialists and an increase in indicator values for nutrients were more pronounced than in protected areas.\nKlinkovská, K., Sperandii, M.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The analysis of floristic records from the Pladias database detected significant changes in the Czech flora over the past six decades. The results revealed five main patterns of temporal change of individual species. The increasing species were supported by different environmental changes that peaked at different periods. Competitively strong, nutrient-demanding generalist species and species successful in colonising new habitats increased significantly from 1961 to 1980. The spread of these species was likely supported by eutrophication and anthropogenic disturbances, such as construction sites, built-up areas, roads, and open-pit mines, during this period. Shade-tolerant species of less disturbed habitats increased between 1981 and 2000, indicating an effect of habitat abandonment. Thermophilous species have begun to spread over the last 20 years, reflecting the rise in temperatures. Competitively strong species of less frequently disturbed habitats with higher moisture and nutrient requirements and low light requirements increased gradually over the last six decades. In contrast, specialised species of nutrient-poor habitats with low colonisation and competitive ability, associated with more frequent but less severe disturbances, steadily decreased due to the ongoing decline of habitat quality after the cessation of traditional management, and many of them have been included in the national Red List.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShiny app showing trends of individual species: https://klaraklink.shinyapps.io/pladias_occ_models/\n\n\n\n\nKlinkovská, K., Glaser, M., Danihelka, J., Kaplan, Z., Knollová, I., Novotný, P., Pyšek, P., Řezníčková, M., Wild, J. & Chytrý, M.

The primary objective of my dissertation was to provide a comprehensive synthesis of changes in the non-forest vegetation and both forest and non-forest flora of the Czech Republic over recent decades. The individual studies identified temporal changes in both vascular plant species and plant communities at regional and national scales and compared the differences in changes between habitat types and time periods.\nThe project consisted of three specific objectives:\n1. To characterise regional changes in specific vegetation types through resurvey studies in areas where such studies were missing.\n2. To assess trends of vegetation change across vegetation types by a joint analysis of existing vegetation-plot data from earlier resurveys performed in the Czech Republic, which were collected for this purpose.\n3. To assess trends in plant species diversity based on the analysis of data from floristic databases.\n📗 Read dissertation thesis"

    "text": "The data paper introduces the ReSurveyEurope database, which comprises resurveyed vegetation plots from all habitats across Europe. Version 1.0 contains 79,190 resurveyed plots (283,135 observations) from 449 independent resurvey projects. Permanent plots marked in the field or located with differential GPS constitute 78% (62,139 plots) of the dataset. The remaining 22% (17,051 plots) come from studies in which plots from the initial survey could not be relocated exactly. Most of the plots (64%, 50,720 plots) contain information about species abundance, such as percentage cover or cover–abundance classes, including variants of the Braun-Blanquet scale. The remaining 36% (28,470 plots) coming from four datasets provide information about the presence/absence of individual plant species. The oldest plots were sampled in 1911 in the Swiss Alps, while the majority of plots were sampled between 1950 and 2020. The Czech Republic is ranked as the ninth most contributing country according to the number of plots. Resurveyed plots from the Czech Republic account for 2% of the dataset (1,544 plots, 14,242 observations). Most of the data from the Czech Republic (1,508 plots, 13,543 observations) include information on species abundances. The oldest plots in the Czech Republic were sampled in 1936, and the longest time series collected data from single plots over more than 60 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data from the ReSurveyEurope database can be requested in accordance with the Data Property and Governance Rules of ReSurveyEurope, available at https://euroveg.org/resurvey/.\n\n\n\nKnollová, I., Chytrý, M., Bruelheide, H., Dullinger, S., Jandt, U., Bernhardt-Römermann, M., Biurrun, I., de Bello, F., Glaser,M., Hennekens, S., Jansen, F., Jiménez-Alfaro, B., Kadaš, D., Kaplan, E., Klinkovská, K., Kuzemko, A., Lenzner, B., Pauli, H., Sperandii, M.

I prepared a publication focusing on patterns of species richness in forests of Montenegro, the western Balkan diversity hotspot, which is currently under review. Moreover, I analysed patterns of species diversity along a latitudinal gradient across the West Siberian Plain and north Kazakhstan, aiming to understand the drivers of species diversity patterns. The manuscript based on these results has been recently submitted to a scientific journal."
